# Cloth_Store_Analysis
Vrinda Store wants to create an annual sales report for 2022. So that, store can understand their customers and grow more sales in 2023.
I have done sale analysis for a store for year 2022 so that by observing the sales trend head of the company can decide which items he should focus on depending on the month and various categories.
Here I have performed data cleaning and data analysis using advance excel skillset.
